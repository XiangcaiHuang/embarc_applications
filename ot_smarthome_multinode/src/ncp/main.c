 * \brief	OpenThread Network Co-Processor(NCP) example on MRF24J40
 *
 * \details
 * ### Extra Required Tools
 *
 * ### Extra Required Peripherals
 *     * 1 x EMSK
 *     * 1 x Digilent PMOD RF2 (MRF24J40)
 *     * 1 x SD card
 *     * 1 x microUSB-USB cable
 *
 * ### Design Concept
 *     This example is an OpenThread NCP application on PMOD RF2 (MRF24J40).
 *     The Thread NCP example demonstrates an OpenThread application that can serve as a low-power wireless NCP
 *       to communicate with Userspace WPAN Network Daemon (wpantund) on Unix-like operating systems.
 *     This example has similar functionality as the NCP example available in the official OpenThread repository,
 *       but has been adapted to use with the embARC OSP.
 *
 * ### Usage Manual
 *     - See \ref EMBARC_BOARD_CONNECTION "EMSK" to connect PMOD RF2 (MRF24J40).
 *     - Connect the board to the Gateway(Raspberry Pi) through USB.
 *     - Run the Gateway(wpantund and wpanctl).
 *
 *     - How to use this example
 *
 *       * Program the secondary bootloader application into onboard SPI flash of EMSK.
 *       * Generate boot.bin of the Openthread NCP example using "make bin".
 *       * Run Openthread NCP example with boot.bin from SD card. Make sure Bit 4 of the onboard DIP switch is ON to enable
 *         the secondary bootloader.
 *         - Insert SD Card back to one EMSK. Press the reset button to reboot it. Wait for loading boot.bin from SD card.
 *         - Initialize Thread NCP process automatically.
 *         - Wait 20 seconds for completing Thread configuration. Then, operation in the wpanctl:
 *           Enter "status" to see the state of the NCP, offline or associated. Enter "scan" to find out the Thread network available.
 *           If you'd like to join a new network, enter "leave" to disconnect the primary network. Then, enter "set Network:Key --data [masterkey]",
 *             and enter "join [number]" to join the new network.
 *         - Enter other commands of the OpenThread NCP CLI to get more information.

 * ![ScreenShot of 'start' and 'ping' in OpenThread](./doc/screenchots/emsk_openthread_configuration.jpg)
 *
 *
 * ### Extra Comments
 *     * Use AC adapter to ensure a steady power supply.
 *     * This example can be used along with OpenThread Smarthome Applicationâ€™s Gateway solution 
 *       to provide Internet connectivity to the Thread network.
 *     * The NCP application starts in disconnected state, and remains so until it is appropriately configured by the Gateway.
 *       After NCP is connected to the Gateway, NCP will try to connect to the existing network or form a new one.
